SOME NOTES AND PROGRAMS IN LEARNING
## Octave code to simulate CCCV charge.ipynb   
>*CCCV means constant current constant voltage*   
>*based on Lesson 2-4-1, you can check the handout for methematical derivation*   
>*an established model ( parameters set) is needed*      
## Octave code to simulate CPCV charge.ipynb   
>*CPCV means constant power constant voltage*   
>*CCCV and CPCV are both common charging methods*   
>*based on Lesson 2-4-2, you can check the handout for methematical derivation*   
>*an established model ( parameters set) is needed*
